# ðŸ§  MLP (Multilayer Perceptron) Neural Network Using PyTorch

This repository contains an implementation of a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** model in **PyTorch** for predicting GDP based on various country-level features. The dataset used is a cleaned version of the CIA World Factbook dataset (`clean.csv`), which was preprocessed and uploaded for ease of experimentation and learning.

## ðŸ“œ Background: What is a Neural Network?

A **Neural Network** is a type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of connected nodes ("neurons") that can learn complex patterns in data. When structured in layers (input, hidden, and output), this becomes a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** â€” one of the simplest forms of deep learning models.

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts:

- **Weights & Bias**: Think of weights as importance multipliers for each input. A bias allows the model to shift its predictions up or down. Together, they shape how the model makes predictions.
  
- **Learning Rate**: Controls how fast the model adjusts weights/biases. If itâ€™s too high, it might overshoot the correct value. Too low and training becomes very slow.

- **Loss Function**: A mathematical formula to measure how far the model's predictions are from the actual results. We try to minimize this during training.

- **Gradient Descent**: A method that adjusts weights and biases to reduce the loss. Like climbing down a hill step-by-step to reach the bottom (lowest error).

## ðŸ“ˆ Why MLP?

MLPs are **universal approximators**, meaning they can learn nearly any function given enough data and time. They're particularly good for structured/tabular data, like the one used here.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Used

- **Filename**: `clean.csv`
- This dataset contains cleaned and preprocessed country-level indicators.
- The **target column** is `gdp`, which the model tries to predict using other features.
- Cleaned beforehand so you can jump straight into building your neural network in PyTorch.

## ðŸ§ª What This Project Does

- Loads the clean dataset
- Prepares a custom PyTorch dataset and DataLoader
- Defines a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using `torch.nn`
- Trains the model to predict GDP values
- Evaluates the model using Mean Squared Error and RÂ² Score

## ðŸ›  How It Works â€“ Step-by-Step

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Load dataset using `pandas`
- Split into features (`X`) and target (`y`)
- Use `train_test_split` to split into training and test data
- Optionally scale the data using `StandardScaler`

### 2. **Custom Dataset Class**
- `factbook_data` class helps load data in a way PyTorch understands
- Makes it easier to use with DataLoaders for batch training

### 3. **Model Architecture**
- Built using PyTorch's `nn.Sequential`
- 2 hidden layers with ReLU activation functions
- 1 output neuron to predict the GDP

### 4. **Training**
- Loss function: `L1Loss` (also called Mean Absolute Error)
- Optimizer: `Adagrad` (adaptive learning rate)
- Trained for 5 epochs using a batch size of 10

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Uses test set to evaluate how well the model predicts unseen data
- Metrics used:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** â€“ lower is better
  - **RÂ² Score** â€“ closer to 1 is better
